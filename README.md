# AWS Serverless template

This template was created to facilitate the start of a project with serverless framework empty.

In this template we already have a `/users` CRUD route.

If you find improvements, please help and improve this tempalte ;)


## How to use


```
npm install
npm start
```

## Deploy

You need run `serverless deploy`, but for this you need configure in your machine the credentials of AWS Amazon, see this doc: https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/
